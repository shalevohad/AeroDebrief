# ? Solution File Fixed!

## Problem Resolved

The `AeroDebrief.sln` solution file was only showing 3 projects (Common, SharedAudio, SimpleRawExport) because it was the old solution file from before the migration.

## What Was Done

Recreated the solution file with **all 7 projects**:

### ? Source Projects (src/)
1. **AeroDebrief.Core** - Core library with shared logic
2. **AeroDebrief.CLI** - Command-line interface application
3. **AeroDebrief.UI** - WPF user interface application
4. **AeroDebrief.Integrations** - TacView and Lua integrations

### ? Test Projects (tests/)
5. **AeroDebrief.Tests** - MSTest unit tests

### ? External Projects (External/SRS/)
6. **Common** - SRS Common library (submodule)
7. **SharedAudio** - Native audio libraries (submodule)

## Solution Structure in Visual Studio

The solution is now organized with **solution folders**:

```
AeroDebrief Solution
??? ?? src
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Core
?   ??? AeroDebrief.CLI
?   ??? AeroDebrief.UI
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Integrations
??? ?? tests
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Tests
??? ?? External
    ??? ?? SRS
        ??? Common
        ??? SharedAudio
```

## Verification

? **Build Status**: Solution builds successfully with all projects!

### Verify in Visual Studio:
1. Close and reopen Visual Studio
2. Open `AeroDebrief.sln`
3. You should now see all 7 projects in Solution Explorer
4. Build should work: `Ctrl+Shift+B` or `Build > Build Solution`

### Verify from Command Line:
```powershell
# List all projects in solution
dotnet sln AeroDebrief.sln list

# Build solution
dotnet build AeroDebrief.sln --configuration Release

# Run tests
dotnet test AeroDebrief.sln --configuration Release
```

## What's Different Now

### Before (Old Solution)
```
AeroDebrief.sln
??? Common (External)
??? SharedAudio (External)
??? SimpleRawExport (Old)
```
? Missing all new modular projects

### After (New Solution)
```
AeroDebrief.sln
??? src/
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Core
?   ??? AeroDebrief.CLI
?   ??? AeroDebrief.UI
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Integrations
??? tests/
?   ??? AeroDebrief.Tests
??? External/SRS/
    ??? Common
    ??? SharedAudio
```
? Complete modular structure with all projects

## Next Steps

Now that the solution is complete, follow the **FINAL_CHECKLIST.md** to finish the migration:

1. **Fix Beta Workflow** (if not done):
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item ".github\workflows\beta.yml.template" ".github\workflows\beta.yml" -Force
   ```

2. **Update Namespaces**:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "scripts\update-namespaces.ps1"
   ```

3. **Rebuild Everything**:
   ```powershell
   dotnet clean AeroDebrief.sln
   dotnet build AeroDebrief.sln --configuration Release
   dotnet test AeroDebrief.sln --configuration Release
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**:
   ```powershell
   git add AeroDebrief.sln
   git commit -m "fix: Update solution file with all modular projects"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Benefits

? **All projects visible** in Visual Studio Solution Explorer
? **Single-click build** for entire solution
? **Project dependencies** properly tracked
? **Organized structure** with solution folders
? **IntelliSense** works across all projects
? **Find All References** works solution-wide

**Your solution is now complete and ready to use!** ??

Open `AeroDebrief.sln` in Visual Studio and you'll see all your projects properly organized.
