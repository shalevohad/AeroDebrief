# AeroDebrief

AeroDebrief is a debriefing and analysis tool for flight simulations. It focuses on capturing and analysing live, online voice communications from networked sessions â€” specifically from Simple Radio Standalone (SRS) servers or other compatible networked voice systems.

Important: AeroDebrief is designed for online voice interrogation of flights via an SRS-style server (UDP/TCP based voice and metadata). It is *not* intended to record or intercept the internal, offline DCS in-sim radio subsystem. If you are running a single-player or local-only DCS session that uses DCS' internal radio channels, AeroDebrief will not capture those internal comms.

## Key features
- Live capture of networked voice (SRS) and associated player metadata
- Frequency and presence analysis for live sessions
- Recording of received audio packets with per-player metadata
- Integration points and export support for third-party tools (for example TacView)

## Integrations
The `AeroDebrief.Integrations` project contains integration code and helpers for connecting AeroDebrief output with external tools such as TacView (flight visualization) and DCS Lua export pipelines. Some integration components are work-in-progress or provided as placeholders to guide implementers.

## Getting started
1. Run or connect to an SRS-compatible server. AeroDebrief listens to the networked voice and metadata published by the server.
2. Configure the recorder to point at the SRS server IP/port in the UI or configuration.
3. Start a recording or analyse live frequencies using the UI.
4. AeroDebrief captures all SRS radio traffic during your DCS missions and presents it through an intuitive interface with advanced analytics capabilities:
* Multi-frequency recording - Capture communications across all active radio frequencies simultaneously
* Advanced waveform visualization - Interactive waveform display with zoom, pan, and timeline navigation
* Frequency-based filtering - Isolate and analyze specific frequencies with individual gain and pan controls
* Real-time analytics - Visualize user presence, power distribution, signal quality, and communication statistics
* Playback controls - Precise playback with transport controls, seeking, and timeline markers
* Network visualization - See who's connected to which frequencies in real-time with animated presence graphs

Whether you're conducting after-action reviews, training sessions, or just want to relive your missions, AeroDebrief provides the tools you need.

* ## Notes and limitations
- AeroDebrief only receives voice and metadata exposed over the network by an SRS-style server. That means you must be participating in or connected to a multiplayer session using an external voice relay (SRS) or equivalent.
- AeroDebrief does not hook into or read DCS' internal IPC or in-sim radio system.
- Privacy: respect the rules and consent of servers and pilots before recording or analysing voice communications.
